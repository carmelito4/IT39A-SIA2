"Cybersecurity Threats in Digital"

Goals 

Cybersecurity threats are made to take advantage of weaknesses in digital systems for a variety of nefarious ends. The following categories can be used to group the primary objectives of cyber threats.

Roles 

Threats to cybersecurity have a big impact on how the digital world is shaped, affecting risk management techniques, security regulations, and technological advancements. Even if they have a detrimental effect, knowing their functions aids in creating stronger defenses.

Audience 

Businesses and Organizations - Target:
Companies store sensitive customer and financial data.

Government Agencies and National Security - Government systems hold classified information, making them prime targets for cyber espionage.

Individual Internet Users - Personal information ( emails, password, banking details) is valuable for identity theft and financial fraud.

Situation 

The frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity threats have increased, impacting people, companies, and governments globally. Cybercriminals take advantage of the new vulnerabilities brought about by the quick development of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital transformation. An outline of the current state of cybersecurity threats can be found below.

Objectives 

The objectives of cybersecurity threats in the digital space revolve around various malicious intentions that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Some key objectives include:  

1. Data Breach & Theft– Cybercriminals aim to steal sensitive personal, financial, or corporate data for illegal activities like identity theft and fraud.  
2. Disruption of Services – Attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) seek to overload systems, making online services unavailable.  
3. Financial Gain – Many cyber threats, like ransomware and phishing, aim to extort money from individuals and organizations.
